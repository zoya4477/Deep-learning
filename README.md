## ðŸš€ Tasks

### **Task 3 â€“ Real-Time Object Detection (YOLO)**
- Implemented real-time object detection using the **YOLO** algorithm.  
- Used a pre-trained model to detect and label multiple objects in live video feeds or images.  
- Tools: Python, OpenCV, PyTorch.

### **Task 4 â€“ Facial Emotion Recognition**
- Trained a **CNN** model on the **FER-2013** dataset to classify emotions (happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc.).  
- Tools: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib.
